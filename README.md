# AI Workshop for Visual Inspection

## Agenda
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a critical component of engineering systems today. In the field of visual inspection, AI is being used to design and develop smarter ways to detect and classify defects in images and video.

This hands-on workshop will require you to write and run code in MATLAB&reg; Online&trade;. You will learn how to apply principles of AI (machine learning, deep learning, domain-specific preprocessing) to visual inspection workflows. These include:  

* Familiarizing yourself with MATLAB Online and AI tools with an introductory example that explores image classification.  
* Implementing preprocessing techniques like object detection, image registration, scene color matching  
* Diving deep into an advanced visual inspection workflow that covers anomaly detection and classification.  

MathWorks instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) will be available throughout the session to guide you. If the event is being held onsite, please bring your laptop and install the Google Chrome browser beforehand.
